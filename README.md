# FE-UI-mod
This is the custom UI mod created by zReal (userutf8) for Fallen Earth MMO game.
It's sill WIP but you can use it.
Crosshair is attached to Vitals UI

How to install:
1. Open Fallen Earth skins folder, e.g. D:\Fallen Earth\skins.
2. Copy cyan folder from this project to your skin folder.
3. Run FE and select 'cyan' skin in game.

You may want to adjust your settings manually to position the crosshair precisely:
1. Open your user settings folder: e.g. D:\Fallen Earth\Settings\User
2. Open .ini file with a notepad or any other text editor, e.g. for a toon named zReal, i will open the file zReal.ini
3. Then in the file find a line VITALS=<text>, e.g. in my case it's VITALS=,mx-1,my-1,fx1106,fy1830,wd458,ht97,op65405,sh1,mn0,tb0,ws0
4. Then adjust fx and fy to match your screen and resolution until mod crosshair overlaps default game crosshair precisely
(you can use a sniper rifle in targeting mode in a prone stance in order to reach max accuracy)
- Then you can switch off the default game crosshair, if you need.
- If you need to disable the mod crosshair later, just drop Vitals opacity to zero in game.
